===========

This project contains a collection of 3D models and STL files for robot chassis and pi camera mount for Dexter Industries BrickPi Case version 2.

The models were created in Sketchup and tested on SeeMeCnc Rostock Max V2. I used both PLA and ABS. You may need to modify the designs if your printer has different tolerances. If your printer isn't properly calibrated, the pieces may not fit correctly. These designs are open source, so feel free to modify change and edit to suit your needs.
